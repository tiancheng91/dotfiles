;;; Commentary:

;; This library is meant to provide the glue between modules that want
;; to establish a network connection to a server for protocols such as
;; IMAP, NNTP, SMTP and POP3.

;; The main problem is that there's more than a couple of interfaces
;; towards doing this.  You have normal, plain connections, which are
;; no trouble at all, but you also have TLS/SSL connections, and you
;; have STARTTLS.  Negotiating this for each protocol can be rather
;; tedious, so this library provides a single entry point, and hides
;; much of the ugliness.

;; Usage example:

;; (open-protocol-stream
;;  "*nnimap*" buffer address port
;;  :type 'network
;;  :capability-command "1 CAPABILITY\r\n"
;;  :success " OK "
;;  :starttls-function
;;  (lambda (capabilities)
;;    (if (not (string-match "STARTTLS" capabilities))
;;        nil
;;      "1 STARTTLS\r\n")))

(require 'starttls)

(defun open-protocol-stream (name buffer host service &rest parameters)
  "Open a network stream to HOST, possibly with encryption.
Normally, return a network process object; with a non-nil
:return-list parameter, return a list instead (see below).

The first four parameters, NAME, BUFFER, HOST, and SERVICE, have
the same meanings as in `open-network-stream'.  The remaining
PARAMETERS should be a sequence of keywords and values:

:type specifies the connection type, one of the following:
  nil or `network'
             -- Begin with an ordinary network connection, and if
                the parameters :success and :capability-command
                are also supplied, try to upgrade to an encrypted
                connection via STARTTLS.  Even if that
                fails (e.g. if HOST does not support TLS), retain
                an unencrypted connection.
  `plain'    -- An ordinary, unencrypted network connection.
  `starttls' -- Begin with an ordinary connection, and try
                upgrading via STARTTLS.  If that fails for any
                reason, drop the connection; in that case the
                returned object is a killed process.
  `tls'      -- A TLS connection.
  `ssl'      -- Equivalent to `tls'.
  `shell'    -- A shell connection.

:return-list specifies this function's return value.
  If omitted or nil, return a process object.  A non-nil means to
  return (PROC . PROPS), where PROC is a process object and PROPS
  is a plist of connection properties, with these keywords:
   :greeting -- the greeting returned by HOST (a string), or nil.
   :capabilities -- a string representing HOST's capabilities,
                    or nil if none could be found.
   :type -- the resulting connection type; `plain' (unencrypted)
            or `tls' (TLS-encrypted).

:end-of-command specifies a regexp matching the end of a command.
  If non-nil, it defaults to \"\\n\".

:end-of-capability specifies a regexp matching the end of the
  response to the command specified for :capability-command.
  It defaults to the regexp specified for :end-of-command.

:success specifies a regexp matching a message indicating a
  successful STARTTLS negotiation.  For instance, the default
  should be \"^3\" for an NNTP connection.

:capability-command specifies a command used to query the HOST
  for its capabilities.  For instance, for IMAP this should be
  \"1 CAPABILITY\\r\\n\".

:starttls-function specifies a function for handling STARTTLS.
  This function should take one parameter, the response to the
  capability command, and should return the command to switch on
  STARTTLS if the server supports STARTTLS, and nil otherwise."
