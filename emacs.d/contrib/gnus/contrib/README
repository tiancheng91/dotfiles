The files in this directory are not (yet) part of the Gnus distribution proper.
They may later become part of the distribution, or they may disappear
altogether.

Please note that it is NOT good to just add this directory to `load-path': a
number of files in this directory will become part of more recent Emacs
versions, so that you might be running obsolete libraries with all kinds of ill
effects (cf. `list-load-path-shadows').

The suggested method for installation is to copy those files that you need to a
directory which is in `load-path'.

Here is an overview of the files:

compface.el

	Provides the ELisp-based uncompface program.  It is excellent and
	practical (actually you can replace lisp/compface.el with it), however
	the author is missing and the copyright has not been assigned yet.

gnus-namazu.el

	This file defines the command to search mails and persistent articles
	with Namazu, which is a full-text search engine distributed at
	<http://namazu.org>, and to browse its results with Gnus.

gnus-kill-to-score.el

	Convert kill files to score files.  See (info "(gnus)Converting Kill
	Files").
