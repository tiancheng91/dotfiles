#
# == Panel
#
# The next configuration values determine the layout and placement of the panel. Generally,
# the panel in subtle consists of two independent bars, one on the top and one at the bottom
# of the screen. In Xinerama setups there will only be panels visible on the first screen.
#
# The top and bottom bar can contain different items and will be hidden when empty.
#
# Following items are available:
#
# [*:views*]     List of views with buttons
# [*:title*]     Title of the current active window
# [*:tray*]      Systray icons
# [*:sublets*]   Catch-all for installed sublets
# [*:spacer*]    Variable spacer
# [*:separator*] Insert separator

# == Colors
#
# Colors directly define the look of subtle, valid values are:
#
# [*hexadecimal*] #0000ff
# [*decimal*]     (0, 0, 255)
# [*names*]       blue
#
# Whenever there is no valid value for a color set - subtle will use a default one. There
# is only one exception to this: If no background color is given no color will be set. This
# will ensure a custom background pixmap won't be overwritten.

# == Gravities
#
# Gravities are predefined sizes a window can be set to. There are several ways to set a
# certain gravity, most convenient is to define a gravity via a tag or change them during
# runtime via grab. Subtler and subtlext can also modify gravities.
#
# A gravity consists of four values which are a percentage value of the screen size. The first
# two values are x and y starting at the center of the screen and he last two values are the
# width and height.
#
# === Example
#
# Following defines a gravity for a window with 100% width and height:
#
#   :example = [ 0, 0, 100, 100 ]
#
gravity :top_left,      [0, 0, 50, 50]
gravity :top_left66,    [0, 0, 50, 66]
gravity :top_left33,    [0, 0, 50, 34]
gravity :top,           [0, 0, 100, 50]
gravity :top66,         [0, 0, 100, 66]
gravity :top33,         [0, 0, 100, 34]
gravity :top_right,     [100, 0, 50, 50]
gravity :top_right66,   [100, 0, 50, 66]
gravity :top_right33,   [100, 0, 50, 34]

gravity :bottom_left33, [0, 100, 50, 34]
gravity :bottom,        [0, 100, 100, 50]

# == Grabs
#
# Grabs are keyboard and mouse actions within subtle, every grab can be assigned either
# to a key and/or to a mouse button combination. A grab consists of a chain and an action.
#
# === Chain
#
# A chain is a string of modifiers, mouse buttons and normal keys separated by a hyphen.
#
# ==== Modifiers:
#
# [*S*] Shift key
# [*A*] Alt key
# [*C*] Control key
# [*W*] Super (Windows key)
# [*M*] Meta key
#
# ==== Mouse buttons:
#
# [*B1*] Button1
# [*B2*] Button2
# [*B3*] Button3
# [*B4*] Button4
# [*B5*] Button5
#
# === Action
#
# An action is something that happens when a grab is activated, this can be one of the following:
#
# [*symbol*] Run a subtle action
# [*string*] Start a certain program
# [*array*]  Cycle through gravities
# [*lambda*] Run a Ruby proc
#
# === Example
#
# This will create a grab that starts a xterm when Alt+Enter are pressed:
#
#   "A-Return" => "xterm"
#

# Host specific

#
# == Tags
#
# Tags are generally used in subtle for placement of windows. This placement is strict,
# that means that - aside from other tiling window managers - windows must have a matching
# tag to be on a certain view. This also includes that windows that are started on a certain
# view will not automatically be placed there.
#
# There are to ways to define a tag:
#
# [*string*] With a WM_CLASS/WM_NAME
# [*hash*]   With a hash of properties
#
# === Default
#
# Whenever a window has no tag it will get the default tag and be placed on the default view.
# The default view can either be set by the user with adding the default tag to a view by
# choice or otherwise the first defined view will be chosen automatically.
#
# === Properties
#
# Additionally tags can do a lot more then just control the placement - they also have properties
# than can define and control some aspects of a window like the default gravity or the default
# screen per view.
#
# [*:float*]   This property either sets the tagged client floating or prevents it from being
#              floating depending on the value.
# [*:full*]    This property either sets the tagged client to fullscreen or prevents it from being
#              set to fullscreen depending on the value.
# [*:gravity*] This property sets a certain to gravity to the tagged client, but only on views that
#              have this tag too.
# [*:match*]   This property influcences the matching of tags, per default tags will only match the
#              WM_NAME and the WM_CLASS portion of a client. Match expects an array with following
#              possible values:
#
#              [*:name*]       match the WM_NAME
#              [*:instance*]   match the first (instance) part from WM_CLASS
#              [*:class*]      match the second (class) part from WM_CLASS
#              [*:role*]       match the window role
# [*:regex*]   This property sets the matching pattern for a tag. Matching works either via plain,
#              regex (see regex) or window id. If a pattern matches more than once ONLY the first
#              match will be used.
# [*:resize*]  This property either enables or disables honoring of client resize hints and is
#              independent of the global option.
# [*:screen*]  This property sets a certain to screen to the tagged client, but only on views that
#              have this tag too. Please keep in mind that screen count starts with 0 for the first
#              screen.
# [*:size*]    This property sets a certain to size as well as floating to the tagged client, but
#              only on views that have this tag too. It expects an array with x, y, width and height
#              values.
# [*:stick*]   This property either sets the tagged client to stick or prevents it from being set to
#              stick depending on the value. Stick clients are visible on every view.
# [*:urgent*]  This property either sets the tagged client to be urgent or prevents it from being
#              urgent depending on the value. Urgent clients will get keyboard and mouse focus
#              automatically.
